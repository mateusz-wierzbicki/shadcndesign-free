              Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king
              who spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors
              came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
            </p>

            {/* First Section - The King's Plan */}
            <h2

              The King&apos;s Plan
            </h2>

            <p className="leading-7">
              The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with a
              brilliant plan: he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.
            </p>

            {/* Quote Block - King's Statement */}
            <blockquote className="border-l-2 pl-6 italic">
              &quot;After all,&quot; he said, &quot;everyone enjoys a good joke,
              so it&apos;s only fair that they should pay for the
              privilege.&quot;
            </blockquote>

              The Joke Tax
            </h3>

            <p className="leading-7">
              The king&apos;s subjects were not amused. They grumbled and
              complained, but the king was firm:
            </p>

            {/* Tax Rates List */}
            <ul
              className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2"
              aria-label="Joke tax rates"

              <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
              <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
              <li>3rd level of one-liners: 20 gold coins</li>
            </ul>

            {/* Story Continuation */}
            <p className="leading-7">
              As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell
              into a gloom. But there was one person who refused to let the
              king&apos;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named
              Jokester.
            </p>

            {/* Third Section - Jokester's Revolt */}
            <h3 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
              Jokester&apos;s Revolt
            </h3>

            <p className="leading-7">
              Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night
              and leaving jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s
              pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was
              furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-7">
              And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the
              jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t help
              but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn&apos;t
              stop.
            </p>

            <h3 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
              The People&apos;s Rebellion
            </h3>

            <p className="leading-7">
              The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter,
              started to tell jokes and puns again, and soon the entire kingdom
              was in on the joke.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-7">
              The king, seeing how much happier his subjects were, realized the
              error of his ways and repealed the joke tax. Jokester was declared
              a hero, and the kingdom lived happily ever after.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-7">
              The moral of the story is: never underestimate the power of a good
              laugh and always be careful of bad ideas.
